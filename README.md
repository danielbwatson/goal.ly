# About

[goal.ly](http://goal.ly) is a goal tracking website written in Grails.

This was created as my Computer Science Senior Project.

This project allows the user to enter multiple questions.  It then polls
the user, via email, for the answers to those questions and graphs the
results over time.  Only questions of type boolean, numeric,
or that use numeric Likert scale are supported.
